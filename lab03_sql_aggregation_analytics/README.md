# Lab 3 – SQL Aggregations for Business Analytics

**Author:** Jai Sharma

##  Project Overview

This lab focuses on using **SQL aggregation techniques to answer business and analytical questions** from relational data.  
Rather than retrieving individual records, the emphasis is on **summarizing data**, identifying patterns, and producing metrics that support decision-making.

The project uses a farmers market sales dataset to simulate real-world business scenarios involving revenue analysis, product performance, and merchant comparison.

## Key Analytics Skills Learned

###  Turning Raw Data into Metrics
I learned how to move from raw transactional data to meaningful business metrics such as:
- total revenue
- average revenue per sale
- product mix percentages
- performance comparisons across entities

This shift helped me understand how analysts **add value beyond data extraction**.

---

###  Practical Use of SQL Aggregation
This lab strengthened my understanding of:
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- `GROUP BY` for segmentation
- aggregate filtering to identify top and bottom performers

These skills form the backbone of **business intelligence and reporting workflows**.

---

###  Handling Imperfect Business Data
The dataset includes realistic challenges such as:
- missing values (`NULL` seasonal booth fees)
- merchants selling across multiple markets
- multiple products per transaction

I learned how these issues affect aggregation results and how to account for them when interpreting outputs.

---

### Structured Analytical Query Building
As queries became more complex, I learned to:
- break problems into smaller analytical steps
- use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to improve readability
- combine aggregation with conditional logic using `CASE`

This approach mirrors how analytical SQL is written in professional environments.

---

###  Translating Business Questions into SQL Logic
Each task began as a business question, for example:
- Which merchants are driving the most revenue?
- How much of a booth’s revenue comes from premium products?
- How do merchants perform across different locations?

I learned how to convert these questions into **clear, accurate SQL queries**, which was the most valuable learning curve in this lab.

---

## Main Learning Curve

The biggest challenge was understanding **the correct level of aggregation**:
- per sale vs per merchant
- per booth vs per market
- transaction-level vs summary-level data

Through iteration and debugging, I gained confidence in building queries that return **correct and interpretable business metrics**.

## 🛠️ Technical & Analytical Skills Demonstrated

- Analytical SQL and aggregation
- Multi-table joins for reporting
- CTE-based query structuring
- Conditional aggregation
- Data validation and interpretation
- Writing maintainable, readable SQL

### Relevance to Data Analyst / Business Analytics Roles

The SQL patterns used in this lab are directly applicable to:
- business intelligence dashboards
- financial and revenue reporting
- product and merchant performance analysis
- data-driven decision support

This project reflects how I approach data analysis: **start with a business question, build the logic carefully, and validate the result**.

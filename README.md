# SQL Coursework Repository

This repository is used to track my SQL learning using PostgreSQL.
As I study SQL concepts in class, I upload my practice work
and assignments here to document what I learn over time.

## What you’ll find here
- SQL practice files written in PostgreSQL
- Lab exercises from coursework
- Queries related to table design and data handling

## Goal
To consistently practice SQL and improve my understanding
by writing and organizing queries as I learn them.
